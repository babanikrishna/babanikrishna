### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I develop and design apps based on a deep understanding of userâ€™s needs. I have worked on projects in App Development and UI/UX Designing. I enjoy exploring and experimentation, and learning about new frameworks, APIs and approaches to continue enhancing my programming process.
